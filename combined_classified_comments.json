We had to do a bunch of work to protect it and essentially make them single use but it works. @dickhardt putting it the url of the frame is the security risk because request urls are logged all over the place (perhaps not in browser history). If it is in a header ... it is not logged (ideally). If what I had proposed existed, it would have significantly reduced the work we needed to do.

    "body": "I provided a version of this feedback in a discussion with @bvandersloot-mozilla, but I thought that I'd surface my feedback on it.\r\n\r\nAn extension to the FedCM is my preferred way to approach this; though the fully-worked standalone example is helpful for understanding the ideas without encumbrance, we have an obligation to reconcile our changes with what exists.  There are also some key aspects of FedCM that are worth retaining.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 things here that are fairly critical extensions to the basic functions that FedCM provides:\r\n\r\n1. A way for a user to log in or sign up to an IdP.\r\n2. A way for the user and IdP to interact and define more precisely what the identity (or token) means.\r\n\r\nBoth address what I consider are major shortcomings of the current FedCM approach.  They both largely follow the same high-level interaction, but the latter really opens up a bunch of authorization cases.\r\n\r\nI like @timcappalli's insistence on the word \"linking\"; it (coincidentally?) highlights my main concern with this sort of interaction model.  No matter what happens here, this sort of API enables *linkability*.  That is, it allows the RP and IdP to link activity on their respective sites to the same person.  Linkability enables [cross-site tracking](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/unsanctioned-tracking/), which is undesirable in the general case and why we now insist on sites gaining explicit and deliberate permission prior to allowing it.\r\n\r\nThat brings me to my next point.  If we are to open up the API to authorization use cases (which I think is justified), there are constraints that a browser might want to apply that aren't necessarily present in existing systems.\r\n\r\nI'm going to use a bit of a bad example here to illustrate my point, but it is the best I have that illustrates the potential for there to be a gap between actuality and practice, so bear with me.  Let's say that you have a vendor of adult beverages who wants some certainty that their customer is over 21.  Now, leaving aside the many problems with this use case[^1], you might imagine the vendor being an RP to an IdP that can authorize the generation of a [verifiable credential (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) that says \"IdP X has verified that this person is over 21\".\r\n\r\nThere is a gap here between the user's understanding of that interaction and the reality.  A user might expect that there is a single bit of information flowing from IdP to RP: whether they are over 21 or not.  Leaving aside the fact that one bit of information can be enough to enable tracking, the sort of exchange contemplated here contains far more information than that.  Consequently, whether or not the RP and IdP act to link user identities across sites, they now have that capability.\r\n\r\nPart of building a system like this is building in controls (like choosers and permissions prompts), but we also need to think about accountability for those cases where sites gain access to these capabilities.  These controls need to be commensurate with the capabilities that are being extended to sites.\r\n\r\nThankfully, I think that the existing FedCM approach provides all we need here to hang off.  The account details that the IdP extends to the RP are bound to an identifier that the browser understands and can present to the user.  That identifier (perhaps with a friendly name and image provided by the IdP) gives us a strong handle that can be the basis of providing feedback and control over the linkage.\r\n\r\nInsisting on authorization flows being elevated to employ all the characteristics of federated login might seem like overreach.  However, the only requirement is the inclusion of a label for each authorization: the identifier.  For each authorization, the IdP can maintain a set of tuples that include the RP, the allocated identifier, the set of resources that were exchanged/authorized with the RP under that identifier, plus supplementary information (a name, a picture, access times, etc...).  The browser can maintain its own view, with stores for each RP that record the IdP, the identifier as known to the RP, the identifier as known to the IdP, any active tokens, and other information.\r\n\r\nIn the degenerate case, the allocated identifier might be the primary identifier for the user at the IdP (`user@idp.example`), but this offers a great opportunity to engage with projected identity (`<random-seeming>@auth.idp.example`).  IdPs can allocate identifiers that aren't linkable to the canonical identifier.  This identifier is then a handle on a specific IdP-RP interaction.  Projected identity is therefore optional, but it gives IdPs a more privacy-respecting option.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more to this that needs to be worked out, like the various revocation flows, but it would help if we could get alignment on a basic model like the one suggested here.  Most of these details should become more tractable once there is a good set of handles that all actors can agree to.\r\n\r\n\r\n[^1]: It's hard to know exactly where to start on the problems with this example, so I'll just point out that online age verification has a long and chequered history.  I will, however, point out that [Privacy Pass](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-privacypass-architecture) and [Private State Tokens](https://wicg.github.io/trust-token-api/) (warning: hard hat area) provide an alternative approach for passing low entropy signals between sites and so might offer a superior approach when applied to this class of problem.",

I think it would be useful to describe how the \"authentication\" use case influences the design decisions in your proposal.\r\n\r\nRE @martinthomson's comment:\r\n1. This credential type would be integrated with \"identity\" using its CredentialRequestOptions.\r\n2. The primary point of this design that is influenced by the AuthN use case is the `FederatedProviderConfig` which is pretty bare to just transmit a `blob` of data associated with a `clientId` and whatever information is needed to make the flow happen (`loginURL`, `style`).\r\n3. The best way to combine Martin's view with this proposal is to roll some of the `IdentityProviderAccount` information into this proposal's `completeFederatedLoginRequest`. In particular, a user-friendly account name and picture URL. This would give the user some way to know what account this is when managing it. Probably unifying the two flows (Server API and Federated Login Status API) would be a tactic I prefer, via changing the argument of  `completeFederatedLoginRequest` to objects representing the Server API responses.\r\n4. Additionally, we would need to augment the `IdentityProviderToken` to represent a broader set of claims representable to the user. The example Martin used here was age > 21. This gives the user the chance to understand what is being exchanged a bit better \r\n\r\n@martinthomson: feel free to correct me if I misunderstand you here.\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     4.

This question is asking if we can manage to do this in the same tab with this approximate structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a little last minute, but I'll try to get my thoughts here before our meeting.

This gives the user the chance to understand what is being exchanged a bit better\r\n\r\nI think that the >21 example was probably misconstrued.  That was a negative example, as in I wanted to highlight something that browsers shouldn't do.  I deliberately chose a bad example for that reason, but I guess it's hard to get this stuff right...\r\n\r\nMy core point was that browsers shouldn't be in the business of arbitrating at that level of granularity.  The shape of the API is such that RP and IdP join identity; that's the real effect of any token exchange, no matter what limitations might be claimed.\r\n\r\nOnce identity is joined, the sites can exchange whatever information they choose for this user, bound only by what they know about the user.  Of course, trustworthy sites will give users control over what they exchange.  But at a technical level, the browser is no longer involved.\r\n\r\nWhat I am aiming to do here is ensure that the browser has a handle (an identifier) that it can use as a handle for talking to the user about what is going on.  That identifier can be used by both sites so that all parties have a basis for building a shared understanding:\r\n\r\n* The browser can say that X is provided by the IdP and given to the RP.\r\n* The IdP can use X when talking about the set of information that is being exchanged with the RP.\r\n* The RP can use X when talking about what it has obtained from the IdP.\r\n\r\nThe information we're talking about here could be traits or authorization information.  The browser doesn't need to care.  But it's not an opaque token, it's something that is both user-visible and a key part of all subsequent interactions.  (Adding a name and picture is potentially helpful in making the handle more manageable and accessible, but secondary.)\r\n\r\nOf more serious import is whether we can do anything to ensure that the identifier can be meaningful to users.  I'm not sure that we have a solid defense here.  What stops an IdP from minting identifiers that appear to reveal nothing (over21@example.com for instance), but then using the API to covertly exchange far more than that?",

    "body": "@bvandersloot-mozilla just wanted to write down here what I hopefully relaid in person at the FedID CG call.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, I wanted to say that we all got this proposal with a good amount of excitement: it was great to see Firefox being creative about variations here and propose ways in which we could help the ecosystem!\r\n\r\nSecond, I wanted to give some validation about the problem statement: `preserve federated login scenarios without adding IDP APIs`. Decreasing operational and deployment costs for IdPs is a really important problem that we would all agree is unsatisfying about FedCM at the moment.\r\n\r\nThird, I'm sure this was intended by you, but something to be said explicitly is that FedCM lacks an \"extensibility\" story: ways in which IdPs can innovate without asking for permission. That, in addition to decreasing costs, is an area that we haven't investigated enough, and are interested in seeing proposals!\r\n\r\nFourth, I loved the way you went about it: you isolated your proposal into something self-contained and easy to review, but made it clear that it probably should live as an extension of something else rather than something on its own. I think that's a great way to make forward progress.\r\n\r\nFifth, I wanted to say that, while it is great to see exploration, we are / were struggling to understand the proposal (specially because it seems that @martinthomson and you are talking about different things when we first read).\r\n\r\nSo, here are some (clarifying-and-genuinely-non-judgemental) questions that I asked you today, along with what I think we heard from you:\r\n\r\n1. Is the permission here per IdP or per Rp/IdP pair? Ben: the latter, per Rp/IdP pair.\r\n2. What does the permission entitle? Third party cookies? Ben: nope, IdP gets loaded as a top-level frame, first party context.\r\n3. At what point does the IdP learn about the Rp? Ben: after the permission is accepted, the browser loads the IdP in a top-level frame with the information about the requestor, the Rp.\r\n\r\nAnd three questions that I think I don't think I got a clear answer from you:\r\n\r\n1. Isn't this already possible with link decoration, `postMessage()` and `window.open()` without any browser permissions? Why would an IdP choose to use this (more constrained and less performant) API if it can already do this? Ben: Good question, let me get back to you on this.\r\n2. You made a few references to the `Login Status API` but this feels similar to the `Storage Access API` when it comes to linking identities with a permission prompt. What's the relationship between this and SAA?\r\n3. Does this API unlock something special later? For example, can the IdP do front-channel logout?\r\n\r\nWhen we started FedCM ([TPAC2020](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/blob/main/meetings/2020/The%20Web%20Platform%2C%20Privacy%20and%20Federation%20-%20TPAC.pdf)) we looked at three different variations. We called them: the Permissions-oriented variation, the Mediation-oriented (what we ended up with) variation and the Delegation-oriented (Personas-like) variation.\r\n\r\nWe were very deliberate about starting with mediation, but we always thought of the permission variation as complementary and co-existing, rather than in opposition of: mediation is always going to be behind, paving the cowpath,  but we need an API that allows IdP to innovate without asking for (the browsers) permission.\r\n\r\nI think this proposal has a lot of similarities to the Permissions-oriented variation: a permission prompt that allows IdPs to control the rest of the flow. Here is a mock that we used early on [1].\r\n\r\nDoes [1] seem right? Is this more or less what you had in mind from a UX / permission perspective (modulo strings, obviously), but also from a browser affordance perspective (i.e. a pop-up window, with an origin attribution, but otherwise capable of loading the expressivity power of HTML/JS/CSS).\r\n\r\nIf this is more or less what you had in mind, I think you'd find a lot of synergy here from us.\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693738/214195535-4def5f5c-6291-495c-a974-f258aaf415f3.gif)\r\n",

This was meant to be seamless access.\r\n\r\nIf we ask a user to take action then it needs to make sense to them, and in such situation the user is not making an informed choice, they're just feeding the browser so it lets them pass. It's not even a choice. 99,99% of all users will have no clue what's going on, they can't possibly know whether the SP is to be trusted or not or whether their choice was the right one (before they actually authenticate).

The 'craziest RP' supported 9 RPs then. This applied for OAuth and OpenID Connect RPs.\n\nCILogon is a RP that brokers access from the eduGAIN federation to a large number of scientific resources. It supports more than 4000 IdP.

But maybe you general point is that exposing a \"total blocking duration\", without subtracting 50ms or including rendering time automatically, is easier to understand?\r\n\r\nRE 2: --Interesting.  That makes some sense...  On the other hand, today LoAF will already slice tasks at processingEnd whenever we know we don't need rendering (i.e. fallback to LongTask time).  And so this proposal would be similar.  Tasks which aren't immediately followed by rendering are \"just tasks\", and not really LoAFs, from the perspective of the \"blocking\" concept.  So we'd have [Task] as distinct entry, then [Task] nested within LoAF but outside \"blocking\" time, and then [Task+Rendering].  If we believe that is the right way, then maybe we just split LoAF entries, and make LoAF.duration == blockingDuration?\r\n\r\nRE 3: -- I think I am mostly in this camp right now.

However...\r\n- React happens to [do its own synthetic event dispatch](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#react-event-object) (See [caveats](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#react-event-object-caveats)) which has some benefits and drawbacks (such as issues like this)\r\n  - Here is one [random article that describes some of the benefits](https://medium.com/@sagnik.das2/what-is-react-synthetic-events-8d7ad766d821)\r\n  - And one [random article that describes some of the drawbacks](https://medium.com/@jessebillard/react-synthetic-events-are-funny-669a25dc103e)\r\n- In the case of LoAF attribution, because react is acting as a \"wrapper\" for your component code, LoAF can only attribute down to the React library.\r\n  - This is also common on pages that use library that wrap all native APIs, e.g. for measurement.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGenerally, when using frameworks / compilers / bundlers / wrapper libraries... and especially for complex JS-apps using Component style development, it is often the case that the literal source location value returned by LoAF attribution links to a computer generated bundle and with a minified and unreadable name and inconsistent source locations.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, it is expected that you will likely need to rely on source maps (or other lookup methods) to actually show nice developer-readable attribution.  This might require some assistance by frameworks themselves, and LoAF has not be available for very long.  (Though some analytics providers are beginning to offer some of this as a product).\r\n\r\nFor local development, I would say this attribution is expected to be more useful if you use more Vanilla JS approaches to scheduling -- and over time, perhaps JS frameworks will be able to leverage more \"vanilla\" scheduling directly, as the reasons for wrappers are largely historic and for compatibility reasons at this point (and some frameworks already are more vanilla).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor attributing INP for a project like yours, I would probably:\r\n\r\n- Use the fact that this is calling into ReactDOM as a signal that this is a Component listener that you explicitly added, rather than some 3p library code / global listeners.\r\n- Instead of using the source location, use the `event.target` from the INP attribtion, as well as the `event.type`.\r\n- Use this information (perhaps from RUM) to find the right UI element (likely testing in lab), then just inspect the DOM (or run a perf profile) to find the long event listener.",

The code snippet for the same:\r\n```typescript\r\n\r\n// function logging relevant details to a performance entry\r\n  const analyzePerformanceEntry = (entry) => {\r\n    const { renderStart, firstUIEventTimestamp, blockingDuration, scripts } = entry;\r\n    console.log(`\r\n      Performance Analysis:\r\n      Render Start: ${renderStart}\r\n      First UI Event Timestamp: ${firstUIEventTimestamp}\r\n      Blocking Duration: ${blockingDuration}\r\n      Scripts:\r\n    `);\r\n    scripts.forEach((script) => {\r\n      const { duration, executionStart, sourceURL, sourceFunctionName, invoker, invokerType } = script;\r\n      console.log(`\r\n        Duration: ${duration}\r\n        Execution Start: ${executionStart}\r\n        Source URL: ${sourceURL}\r\n        Source Function: ${sourceFunctionName}\r\n        Invoker: ${invoker}\r\n        Invoker Type: ${invokerType}\r\n      `);\r\n    });\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const REPORTING_THRESHOLD_MS = 150;\r\n    \r\n// performance observer\r\n    const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {\r\n      for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {\r\n        if (entry.duration > REPORTING_THRESHOLD_MS && (entry as any).firstUIEventTimestamp > 0) {\r\n          console.log(\"Long task detected:\", entry);\r\n          analyzePerformanceEntry(entry);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    observer.observe({ type: \"long-animation-frame\", buffered: true });\r\n\r\n// callback function to be passed to the `onINP()` method\r\n    const handleINP = (metric) => {\r\n      const { attribution } = metric;\r\n      const { interactionTarget, interactionTargetElement } = attribution;\r\n\r\n      console.log('INP Attribution:');\r\n      console.log(`Interaction Type: ${interactionTarget}`);\r\n      if (interactionTargetElement) {\r\n        const reactPropsKey = Object.keys(interactionTargetElement).find(key => key.startsWith('__reactProps'));\r\n        const reactProps = reactPropsKey ? interactionTargetElement[reactPropsKey] : {};\r\n\r\n        console.log(`\r\n          Interaction Target Element:\r\n          Node Name: ${interactionTargetElement.nodeName}\r\n          Text Content: ${interactionTargetElement.textContent}\r\n          Parent Node Name: ${interactionTargetElement.parentNode?.nodeName}\r\n          Parent Text Content: ${interactionTargetElement.parentNode?.textContent}\r\n          React Props: ${reactProps ?

The page can be found here: [https://webperf-alpha.vercel.app/dashboard/inp](https://webperf-alpha.vercel.app/dashboard/inp). On loading of this application page on localhost without any CPU Throttling and on Mobile dimensions, I tested for the input: \r\n1. Click on Add Item (4s) button\r\n2. Click on Add Item (3s) button immediately after clicking above\r\n3. Click on Add Item (4s) button again immediately after clicking above.\r\n\r\nThe output behaviour is rather interesting, and I am unable to explain them:\r\nThe first item is added after 4s, the second and third items are loaded together after 7s of the time the first item was loaded. The `interactionTargetElement` shows the 3s button for some reason. There are two doubts here: why is the 2nd and 3rd step above batched together and executed at once (combined delay of 7s?) and why is the target element pointing towards the 3s button and not the 4s button ? The `interactionTarget` docs say:\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * A selector identifying the element that the user first interacted with\r\n   * as part of the frame where the INP candidate interaction occurred.\r\n   * If this value is an empty string, that generally means the element was\r\n   * removed from the DOM after the interaction.\r\n   */\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSo for instance in the case where I first select the 4s button and then immediately click the 3s button, the attribution should point out the element where the interaction started: i.e. the Add Item (4s) button, but it seems the reverse is happening. Am I missing anything here ? An insight into the same would be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nOutput image:\r\n<img width=\"1791\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-29 at 1 57 05\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/w3c/long-animation-frames/assets/171024309/1cd73ce1-ef87-4e20-908d-dc1db12b45b0\">\r\n",

I would guess React is trying it's best to be responsive to the first click, but then batching the rest together to save having to do multiple layouts together?\r\n\r\nGoing  back to the docs:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n   /**\r\n   * A selector identifying the element that the user first interacted with\r\n   * as part of the frame where the INP candidate interaction occurred.\r\n   * If this value is an empty string, that generally means the element was\r\n   * removed from the DOM after the interaction.\r\n   */\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would seem, that in that example, there would be two frames\u2014the first with click 1, and the second with the remaining clicks that React has batched together.\r\n\r\nIn that case the frame with the longest one will be the \"INP frame\". All else being equal this would be the second frame (as it includes multiple clicks so will take multiple processing times to finish). And this is what you are seeing. The `interactionTarget` is set to the first interaction of the INP frame. The prior frame may well have been quite slow, but the subsequent one was slower still. Now I know you're running this with `reportAllChanges: true` but if all the Event Timings are reported together (as could often be the case in cases like this where the main thread is busy), then they will be processed together, but split into frames, so only the second one would be emitted as an INP event.\r\n \r\nSo I think the docs (and the implementation!) are right in this case. But certainly a confusing one if you're not aware how this all works!",

This second one is therefore the ultimate INP for the page. The first INP target is the 4s button, the second is the 3s button:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"774\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/w3c/long-animation-frames/assets/10931297/157a41cf-e96c-4244-b55e-7b09ba0399b5\">\r\n\r\nThe trace shows two distinct interactions:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"733\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/w3c/long-animation-frames/assets/10931297/5da817fa-5c46-49c1-9e5b-d02ea89c37ba\">\r\n\r\nWeirdly the screenshot do not show two step render, but that's what I saw with my own eyes, and if you zoom in there is a paint and a commit between the two confirming a render happened then:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"249\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/w3c/long-animation-frames/assets/10931297/0ea37fde-aa64-42b7-8128-66730005a5b6\">\r\n\r\nSo it looks like on mobile Chrome prefers the early, separate paint, but on desktop it decides to wait and do them both together. Chrome does all sorts of heuristics to decide when to render a frame, especially when it knows there are more inputs to process, and it looks like the mobile and desktop heuristics are slightly different.

Sometimes you have to wait for Renderer to acknowledge feedback from previous events (i.e. IPC messages that start after processingEnd), and before browser can send new IPC about future events...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn this case these were distinct interactions, so I had expected it would work.  I tried myself locally and could repro as Barry says.  It wasn't just luck / races.\r\n\r\nI traced with Perfetto and here is what I see:\r\n\r\n1. Indeed, the second and third events are stuck in browser process waiting for the first event to finish:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-05-31 at 10 14 58](https://github.com/w3c/long-animation-frames/assets/474282/79248419-a34d-46a9-bc6f-154bd5501eee)\r\n\r\nThe 'flow' shows when the browser received the event and forwarded it to the renderer.

By doing this we're encouraging people to potentially add a massive amount of events to the buffer and these memory (and lookup efficiency) problems can potentially explode. It also adds a lot of noise to the performance timeline and to traces.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> What about just a `getEntriesBy*` variant that accepts both a `type` and also a time range (and optionally that this time range can be specified by passing another `entry`)?\r\n> \r\n> The usage would be something like:\r\n> \r\n> * Create a PerformanceObserver for LoAF\r\n> * From each LoAF entry observed, ask for the marks/measures that overlap its timing\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n> As per your original proposal, Related questions:\r\n> \r\n> * It seems not so common to me to have active PerformanceObservers for marks/measures, but if someone did have one, would we want to report these LoAF-only entries?\r\n\r\nI think not, perhaps attach them to the `loaf.scripts` entry?\r\n\r\n> * If we did, would we delay adding these entries into the timeline until after we know if a LoAF happened (i.e. a separate buffer)?\r\n\r\nYea definitely.\r\n\r\n> * If we did that, would we wait only until we know a LoAF is being measured, or wait for the LoAF is done measuring (i.e. LoAF always reported first)?\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the same callback, as in if you observe both types you'd get them concurrently? Otherwise in `PerformanceScriptEntry` which is perhaps more suitable.\r\n\r\n> Also also, there have been requests to add groups/categories/labels to User Timings multiple times for multiple purposes. I wonder if this really needs to be LoAF specific or if it could just be a generic feature like that? Then library authors could use as they see fit and might be more creative that we are here?\r\n\r\nI don't think this is related. One is arbitrary metadata and the other is a capturing condition.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> I guess the question I would have is: is it likely that a library like NewRelic would want to consume marks/measures that were created by a different app/library or just their own? Would NewRelic want to share annotations that would be useful to consume by others? (Such that a common standard us useful?)\r\n\r\nI feel that those are parallel question.\r\nNewRelic can use mark/measure names or new metadata we define to filter out what they care about, but that won't help with exploding the buffer with LoAF-attribution-tracing.\r\n\r\nAn additional thing I would propose for this type of mark/measure is that you can't mark/measure it before/after the fact, as in the timestamp has to be now or at least within the current script entry.\r\n\r\n",

What happened is Privacy Badger's content script sets `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` to `true` (in page JS contexts), but DDG then comes in and overwrites `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` to `false`.\r\n\r\n(Content scripts get injected in ... extension installation order? May as well be random.)\r\n\r\nThis is the second time already Privacy Badger received a bug report with this behavior.\r\n\r\nI'm not completely clear on whether this is a problem with the spec or with the DDG extension. Apologies if this isn't in the right place. Just raising an issue we noticed over at Privacy Badger.",

    "body": "Hey @ghostwords, thanks for reporting this behavior. I just took a look and I think I see what's happening here.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Badger is setting the `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` property with the following [code](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/blob/master/src/js/contentscripts/dnt.js#L31-L35):\r\n``` JavaScript\r\nOBJECT.defineProperty(OBJECT.getPrototypeOf(NAVIGATOR), \"globalPrivacyControl\", {\r\n  get: function globalPrivacyControl() {\r\n    return \"1\";\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThen DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials is setting the `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` property with the following [code](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension/blob/develop/shared/js/content-scripts/GPC.js#L21-L28), which is overriding the value set by Privacy Badger (regardless of whether its run first or second):\r\n``` JavaScript\r\ntry {\r\n  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'globalPrivacyControl', {\r\n    value: false\r\n  })\r\n} catch(e) {}\r\n```\r\nI put the `try...catch` block there in anticipation of other extensions having already set the value directly, which would make this throw an error (attempts to redefine a value defined this way will throw errors since it is by default non-configurable).\r\n\r\nSo basically what's happening here is we're using two different ways (defining the getter and defining the property value) to set the `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` value, and one is overriding the other. I think there are two potential solutions here:\r\n\r\n1. Set both the getter and the value, and wrap in a `try...catch` block. This would throw an error when the value has already been set via either method, which would prevent overriding a signal that's already been set by another extension:\r\n``` JavaScript\r\ntry {\r\n  // will throw error if getter has already been defined\r\n  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'globalPrivacyControl', {\r\n    get: function globalPrivacyControl() {\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n  // will throw error if value has already been defined\r\n  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'globalPrivacyControl', {\r\n    value: true\r\n  })\r\n} catch(e) {}\r\n```\r\n2. Privacy Badger defines value directly instead of defining the getter. The reason I'm listing this as a potential solution but not listing DDG defining getter instead of value is because it appears that defining the value directly overrides defining the getter, but not vice versa.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to make change 1 in the DDG extension to ensure better compat with other extensions, but first out of curiosity is there any reason why Privacy Badger is defining the getter instead of the value itself?",

If a user has any tool installed that has GPC on, the GPC signal should be sent.\r\n\r\nI agree 100% with your logic here. Extensions should set GPC to `true` using the most robust method possible, and should set GPC to `false` in a way that can be overridden by another extension that has GPC on. With this in mind, what do you think about the following extension implementation guidelines?\r\n\r\n#### GPC off:\r\nFirst check if `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` is defined. If yes, then do nothing. Otherwise set `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` to `false` on the prototype as follows:\r\n```` JavaScript\r\nif (typeof navigator.globalPrivacyControl !== \"undefined\") return\r\nObject.defineProperty(Object.getPrototypeOf(navigator), 'globalPrivacyControl', {\r\n    value: false\r\n})\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### GPC on:\r\nFirst check if `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` is defined and set to `true`. If yes, then do nothing. Otherwise set `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` to `true` as follows:\r\n```` JavaScript\r\nif (navigator.globalPrivacyControl) return\r\nObject.defineProperty(navigator, 'globalPrivacyControl', {\r\n    value: true\r\n})\r\n````\r\n\r\nThen if a user has two conflicting extensions that support GPC, say Extension1 and Extension2, and Extension1 is installed first:\r\n#### Extension1 has GPC on, Extension2 has GPC off\r\n- Since Extension2 was installed most recently, it will first set `globalPrivacyControl` to `false` on the navigator prototype\r\n- Then Extension1 will set `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` to `true`, which will override the prototype property. So `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` will return `true`\r\n#### Extension1 has GPC off, Extension2 has GPC on\r\n- Since Extension2 was installed most recently, it will first set `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` to `true`\r\n- Extension1 will see that `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` is truthy and not do anything\r\n\r\n@ghostwords if this approach or something similar works for you, maybe we could align and do something similar with other navigator properties we're setting via our extensions.",

As regards to site behavior, I expect a `Sec-GPC: 0` value would be the same thing as sending nothing.    If a site wants to know that the user turned off GPC in response to the page's request, they can already do though a session cookie (or similar) and seeing that the GPC signal is no longer sent.\r\n\r\nAdding a third state thought to GPC (not sent, sent and 1, and / or sent and 0) adds fingerpritning surface, so unless there is a practical benefit to it, im still in favor of the current description.\r\n\r\nIs there a use case you have in mind that wouldn't be possible for a site to capture otherwise?\r\n\r\nb) By design, other GPC values are not supported.  This is by design, since turning into GPC into a preferece-broadcasting system would have significant risks in the short term (e.g., increased fingerprinting surface) and longer term (e.g., turning GPC into a system where browsers are expected to advertise the privacy preferences their local jurisdiction entitles them to, which would be very bad privacy wise.  A privacy feature that requires me to advertise my location to get privacy is a deeply flawed privacy system.\r\n\r\nHope this helps explain the design of GPC!

Does this mean a decision has been made and you don't want further feedback on this? \r\n\r\nRegardless - Yes, I have use-cases and practical reasons for why I discuss values. Right now GPC has a single interpretation based on CCPA (legally enforceable) and GDPR (legal interpretation). In the EU, there is no notion of 'sell' data or restricting only third parties from 'selling data' - though where consent is used the ability to withdraw that consent to _share_ data with third parties must exist separate from other consent matters. So 'sell' and 'share' are two distinct activities when it comes to how GPC is applied. The 'right to object' is separate and distinct from 'withdrawing consent'. \r\n\r\nRather than saying `GPC: 1` means all of these - which is problematic because it doesn't provide separation between all of these, GPC can be used to express not preferences, but 'rights'. So `GPC: 1` can mean do not share data with third parties on the basis of consent, object where legitimate interest is used for such sharing; and other values can assist in applying other rights.\r\n\r\nFor example; `GPC: 3` can mean share data for research (non-commercial entities) purposes. `GPC: 5` can mean apply objection to first parties legitimate interests as well. `GPC: 7` can mean apply objection to profiling and automated decision making. Values can be combined e.g. by using primes and combinations (e.g. 3 means 1 x 3, 15 means 1 x 3 x 5 applies and so on) or using bit values. Multiple values are feasible since GPC is transmitted not as a boolean but as an integer/character.",

    "body": "As for fingerprinting, IMHO it is not a good strategy to say lets not give users more privacy management and preferences because it _may_ be used for fingerprinting. There *are* separate 'preferences' to mange: giving consent, withdrawing consent, consent for sharing data, consent for sharing data with first party only, consent for sharing data with third parties only, objecting to legitimate interest, objecting to profiling, objecting to direct marketing, objecting to automated decisions. GPC choosing only a few specific ones based on how CCPA works may not represent the best interests of users across the globe. If this is to be a web standard, then it must work for all web users. It has to address 'basic' concepts - either by making them explicit in the spec or by relying on their commonality.\r\n\r\nLike the previous comment says, EU doesn't have 'sell' as a data processing activity. Saying GPC prohibits sharing of data to any 'third party' is not enough - what is a third party also differs by jurisdiction! E.g. processors may or may not be third parties. Similarly, GPC doesn't consider what happens when data is 'shared' by joint-controllers - which is again a jurisdiction specific concept. So is the right to object. What happens when GPC implementation doesn't fulfill jurisdiction-based necessities such as these? Do we again invent a separate signal for these items? See [ADPC](https://www.dataprotectioncontrol.org/spec/). \r\n\r\nAs for inferring jurisdiction, the website is _needed_ to infer these, e.g. to see what laws to comply with. If serving to EU users, GDPR must be complied with. If serving to California users, CCPA must be complied with.

Why not just have GPC specify its state?

I want to share that I read a news story posted on some other site to the actual news publisher. Yes, I want them to track how many views their story got, but they don't profile me.

For background, there were two primary reasons we went with the current implementation:\r\n\r\n### Conflicts caused by competing defaults\r\nNot all implementations set GPC on by default. This can lead to two types of conflicts:\r\n1. User's browser or previously installed extension sets GPC on by default, then user unknowingly turns GPC off by installing an extension that implements GPC but doesn't turn it on by default. Ideally if a user's browser or any installed extension is setting GPC on, it shouldn't be overridden by another extension that is setting GPC off by default.\r\n2. User's browser or previously installed extension implements GPC but does not turn it on by default, then user installs extension that sets GPC on by default. This is only an issue if the extension first checks `if (!Navigator.prototype.hasOwnProperty('globalPrivacyControl'))` before setting the GPC DOM signal, since `Navigator.prototype.globalPrivacyControl` will already be defined as `false` here. Less concerned about this case, we can make it work.\r\n\r\n### Preventing scripts from tampering with GPC signal\r\nIf we allow the GPC DOM property to be configurable, it's possible for a malicious script (or website even) to change the value and prevent the signal from propagating correctly. That is to say, if a website checks `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` before each third party script is loaded, it's possible that this value may not reflect the user's preference. I like your suggestion in the other thread to use `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(Navigator.prototype, 'globalPrivacyControl')?.get.call(navigator)`, but I'm not sure we can count on websites to check the value this way instead of just checking `navigator.globalPrivacyControl`. Either way, I think this is probably a pretty rare edge case and not such a big deal.",

    "body": "> ### Conflicts caused by competing defaults\r\n\r\n> Ideally if a user's browser or any installed extension is setting GPC on, it shouldn't be overridden by another extension that is setting GPC off by default.\r\n\r\nIMO users should be free to install extensions with conflicting behaviors. It's on implementors to try to coexist with each other. I'd prefer if extension-based and web-based implementations backed off if GPC is natively supported by the browser. If this signal is natively supported by the browser, then the browser vendor should provide a settings API which allows extension authors to modify this value.\r\n\r\n> ### Preventing scripts from tampering with GPC signal\r\n\r\nIf a script wants to tamper with GPC, I feel like that's fine. It should be up to the site owner and/or user as to what happens with this property. For example, a site owner's 1st-party JS or user's user agent (browser or extension) may polyfill or modify this feature.\r\n\r\nIf tamper prevention is an intended design goal for this API, you should add `[Unforgeable]` to the WebIDL in the spec. This should not affect API consumers.\r\n\r\nAlso, some clarification with `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(Navigator.prototype, 'globalPrivacyControl')?.get.call(navigator)`: This doesn't actually make `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` references secure by itself. This kind of code is combined with cached interfaces that may need to be used post-init due to potentially hostile code trying to backdoor the post-init environment.\r\n\r\nFor example, I could securely resolve `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` post-init if I so wished, by building on top of references that I know are secure against code loaded later due to my script being the first to run:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// assume potential prototype pollution post-init\r\n// assume all uninitialized variables in this example are cached references\r\nconst doSomething = () => {\r\n  if (navigator && gpcGetter) {\r\n    const GPC = call(gpcGetter, navigator);\r\n    if (GPC) {\r\n      // do something with GPC\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\naddEventListener('some-event', doSomething, { once: true });\r\n```",

    "body": "Thanks. I wrote up on some of the considerations of GPC and GDPR [here](https://harshp.com/research/blog/gpc-gdpr-can-it-work) before Robin's post, so its my opinion rather than a response. I agree with Robin's post, and the spirit of GPC. But disagree that there is a straightforward interpretation in GDPR. There isn't, and the GPC spec should, IMHO, clarify what it should mean under GDPR rather than asking the law to interpret how the signal may be used for it. Its the equivalent of the chicken and egg problem - what comes first? In this case, between the signal and the law, the signal must come first.\r\n\r\nAs to why different values: How can the same signal convey different actions depending on jurisdiction? In CCPA, it restricts 'selling' (Do Not Sell) which when compared with GDPR, is probably equivalent to restriction of sharing data with third parties for commercial(isation) purposes. GDPR does not have a notion of 'selling data', nor does it make a distinction between for-profit purposes. Yet, the [GPC mentions](https://globalprivacycontrol.github.io/gpc-spec/#legal-effects) that:\r\n\r\n> The GPC signal is intended to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user's personal data to other data controllers ([GDPR] Articles 7 & 21).\r\n\r\nSo already here there is an incompatibility between what the signal means depending on whether one happens to be in California or EU (sell vs share). Furthermore,  'third parties', as I mentioned before, are also different concepts across jurisdictions. So the spec should also clarify these because otherwise it remains incompatible with jurisdictional laws. The law can, at most, say signal should be respected in matters of consent or preferences (e.g. ePrivacy Regulation in EU). However, the signal/spec itself must be clear on what its interpretation means. For GPC, CCPA provides an enforceable basis for simply stating 'do not sell', which already exists codified in law. Unfortunately, this has no equivalent in GDPR. There is no 'do not share' signal or right. A generalised  solution would be saying:\r\n\r\n> GPC is \"a signal that indicates restriction of data sharing with third parties\" - and keeping the legal basis (e.g. consent) outside this. Thus, when the signal is active/set, and the legal basis happens to be consent, it indicates the data subject has chosen not to consent to such sharing, or is withdrawing the consent. If the legal basis is legitimate interest, they object to such sharing. This is much clearer IMHO than saying \"withdraws consent\" without being specific as to which consent, or why. \r\n\r\nIf adopted, this then creates an incompatibility between 'do not sell' and 'do not share' (as above) because sell and share do not mean the same thing. And given that GPC is already enforceable in CCPA, its intention and interpretation cannot be changed retrospectively. That's why the original proposal for multiple values as an exploration of how to resolve this.",

If this is a question about a response to the on-page `navigator` Javascript object that GPC is providing, that API does not respond and you should not send messages to it. Generally [the way you say your site is listening for GPC is to have the `.well-known` resource](https://globalprivacycontrol.github.io/gpc-spec/#gpc-support-representation). \r\n\r\nIf you are asking about a HTTP response on the basis of the request coming in with a GPC header, the spec does not suggest a specific response or response code. I'd suspect that your response will change on the basis of why you are rejecting the request. The 451, 403, 412 [and more error codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) might be appropriate depending on both the reason and style of the rejection. That said, some laws have specific language around not forbidding users access on the basis of a privacy choice and you should consult with a lawyer before choosing to reject a request because it has a privacy preference attached. \r\n\r\nDoes that answer your question @KoopaKing ?",

I was really asking about the latter, for requests coming into an API server that happen to specify this, it seems like if the API implementor was not sure of the legal requirements associated with handling a specific request, they may opt for not processing and instead returning an appropriate error.\n\nI agree that depending on the exact reason for thinking the request cannot be processed different error codes may be correct, but I had originally thought that there may be some use in a standardized code or response type for this situation.\n\nMy use case was mostly just exploritory. Specifically I have some REST APIs that use gRPC+Go on the backend and was adding a request processor to easily access the GPC indicator on the request, and make canned decisions before handing the request off to the business logic layer. As a library it seemed like one way you would want to configure it would be to deny requests with the GPC indicator that also meet some conditions (maybe a source IP range believed to be in an unsupportable location). I thought I'd ask if the project itself had a recommendation for standardized \"I can't process this in a guaranteed GPC-compatible way\" response. If not, all good.\n\nThanks for the response!",

It's not a terrible reason, but I'm concerned that the mechanism comes with downsides that are being disregarded.\r\n\r\nWhat I really want to hear is that there is some legally-relevant reason for making a commitment, and whether this sort of resource would be consider adequate toward that end (as in non-repudiable if necessary, etc...).  A better outcome - at least from the legal effect of the system - might be to have no need for any such commitment.\r\n\r\nI'm less convinced by the need to monitor for compliance.  Many sites have privacy policies that could adopt common language about compliance with GPC.  Given the need to understand the complexities of how data is handled by sites and their partners and subsidiaries, I see no significant advantage to having a special signal for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAs for this being cheap, I think that you underestimate the costs involved.  Though it seems simple, I don't think that it really is that easy.  Because there is no immediate effect from compliance, there is no reason for the resource to be actively validated.  And no matter how small a resource is, correctly serving it requires a non-trivial work in most organizations.\r\n\r\nOverall, my view is that a smaller target is better.  That means cutting back on anything that is not very strongly motivated and this is the most complicated piece of the specification.  Well, outside of the essential part where a technical mechanism engages with any number of legal/regulatory mechanisms.",

    "body": "> Unlikely most other browser features, a site supporting GPC won't have any immediate, user (or browser) noticeable effects. This is very different than almost every other browser feature\r\n\r\nIn my view this is an important point. We did GPC usability studies (to appear in PETS next year), and some of the feedback we received from people was that they were unsure whether turning on GPC actually did anything. If there is at least a declaration on a site that it respects GPC, it could be picked up in a browser or other user agent and trigger a UI event.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is evidence that some operators find it useful: [6,093 sites](https://well-known.dev/?q=resource%3A%22gpc%22#results) sites use the resource; [5,869 sites](https://well-known.dev/?q=resource%3A%22gpc%22+gpc_support%3Atrue#results) set it to `true`. Other operators may decide to not use it. That is OK. It is voluntary (personally, I would actually favor the resource to be mandatory).\r\n\r\n> What I really want to hear is that there is some legally-relevant reason for making a commitment ...\r\n\r\nImplementing the resource and setting it to `true` is a declaration that a site respects GPC. That makes life for regulators a bit easier. If a site does not respect GPC contrary to its declaration, there is a clear compliance issue.\r\n\r\n> Many sites have privacy policies that could adopt common language about compliance with GPC. \r\n\r\nThat is true. Respecting GPC could also be written in the privacy policy of a site. But since there is no common language, it would be much harder to automate and scale GPC compliance (declaration) analysis. ",

A few notes:\r\n\r\nFor tracking adoption, the well-known resource is MASSIVELY superior to a statement in the PP, even standardized. I originally threw together gpcsup.com in a few hours - it'd simply not have been feasible to build if I had to find and parse privacy policies. This use case isn't critical, but I think it has value.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, surfacing support status to users in the browser would be reliant on the resource to be practical. I disagree with Robin here - IMO once there's decent adoption browsers should surface it so users can make informed browsing decisions (and if they don't, it should be feasible for extensions to).\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure why sites would need to update it whenever they change \"anything GPC-related\" - or rather I'm not sure what changes would require an update to the resource and be frequent enough to cause an issue? I'd hope sites aren't changing whether they support GPC more than once or twice on average, and as I understand it, the `lastUpdate` field should at max only need to be updated if/when the spec is updated?\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't have particularly strong feelings, but would lean to keep it since it's already there, and IMO it's useful even if it's not essential.",

In general, the discussion tracked the commentary in the thread. The biggest point of agreement was that maintenance of a `well-known` should not be mandatory largely because of the impact on small publishers (it is currently [optional](https://privacycg.github.io/gpc-spec/#gpc-support-resource) in the spec). Otherwise, while there was mild disagreement over the value of the signal, no one seemed to think that the optional resource should be a barrier to going forward with this process. For this reason, the editors indicated on the call that we are likely to close the issue next week --- however, if folks who were not on the call feel more strongly and/or believe that inclusion of an optional `well-known` in the spec would be a barrier to moving forward, please speak up and we can continue to discuss.\r\n\r\nRelatedly, we also discussed whether the optional `well-known` resource should be revised to provide more detailed information about site compliance. Right now the [spec](https://privacycg.github.io/gpc-spec/#gpc-support-representation) only includes a `gpc` field which returns as `true` or `false`, and a `lastUpdated` field to indicate the time the statement of support was made. Seperately, @pes10k has filed PR #48 to propose to clarify that the resource should indicate whether a site respects GPC with respect to _the specific user_ accessing the resource. We also briefly discussed whether a static resource could provide more specificity as to in which jurisdictions GPC is honored, and whether the `lastUpdated` field still provides any value. Assuming we move forward with inclusion of the optional resource, we intend to continue to discuss those options.",

It says: \"The purpose of a GPC Support Resource is for a site to convey its support for the Global Privacy Control.\" I think this could be read to mean either its support for GPC for this particular user or more broadly.\r\n\r\nRight now, the `well-known` field only allows the site to respond with `gpc` as `true` or `false`. If it is a static resource that returns the same result for all users, it's not entirely clear what `true` means. Does it mean that it honors GPC for all users around the world, that it honors GPC in jurisdictions where it's explicitly required, or something else? And separately, there's a question of _how_ it honors GPC: does it stop third-party sharing entirely, just turn off certain advertising pixels, or does it . . . change the default font size.\r\n\r\nPete's PR would address the first question --- the `well-known` provided to a user would tell whether that user's GPC signals are being honored (though it still wouldn't provide information how). Others should speak to the technical challenges with such a dynamic approach, but it would certainly provide more granular and robust data about GPC compliance.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could devise a static resource to provide more detail about the jurisdictions in which it supports GPC instead of the binary result returned today. Presumably companies are honoring GPC is jurisdictions where they are clearly legally required to do so, but the `well-known` could signal when companies are honoring in additional jurisdictions (including jurisdictions where it is unclear what legal effect GPC has).\r\n\r\nLeast ambitiously, we could just revise the spec to clarify (1) that the resource is static and (2) what `true` means.\r\n\r\nI think we should at least do that last bit for clarity's sake. In general, I am leery about introducing major substantive changes to the spec given that it is widely implemented and has legal consequences in some jurisdictions, but I think we can be more flexible with regard to the optional `well-known` (and the `lastUpdated` field would signal whether the company was providing data pursuant to the `well-known`'s original parameters or in a newer format).",

But if whats being asked for is to define a technical, machine enforceable concept for what counts as the \"current session\", i do not think thats necessary or w/in the scope of this spec. Whats meant by \"session\" for \"session cookies\" is similarly ambiguous and left up to the [browser implementors](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-4.1.2) and sites (e.g., \"your session has ended, please log in again\") to work out.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying it wouldn't be useful to the platform to have such a definition, im only saying i. this proposal isn't the only place that references the concept of a session without providing a complete definition of it, and ii. i dont think this spec needs to be clearer than other parts of the platform for it to still be useful.\r\n\r\nI think we need something like this though, and to make it clear that .well-known doesn't describe a site wide policy.  Even if we extended the .well-known to include additional information, like \"these are the jurisdictions or regions or laws I respect GPC under\", it still wouldn't be sufficient to answer the main (to my mind) question of \"if I interact with the site now, will the site respect my GPC-relevant rights.\"\r\n\r\nFor example, if we go the other direction, and have the .well-known describe the site's policy.

In addition to any coding challenges, doing so potentially invites liability if they provide an inadvertently incorrect response, and I am not aware of any user agents that are taking steps to treat publishers differently based on the `well-known` (though that could change if the `well-known` was dynamic).\r\n\r\nI am not sure these three concerns are insurmountable, just noting them.

While honoring GPC is mandatory in California and Bermuda (and possibly other jurisdictions), I think there is still some lack of awareness and/or compliance with GPC. At IAPP yesterday on the CA regulators' panel, the speakers noted that compliance with CCPA more broadly was very inconsistent. Allowing publishers to express _any_ recognition of GPC is still valuable and provides data to researchers and regulators; the trend lines detected by the GPC Support Bot which crawls `well-knowns` have been useful.\r\n\r\nSo I would still support a static resource over nothing.

If the user has activated GPC, it seems like the header should always be transmitted (unless some edge case or technical challenge I'm not thinking of). The user agent generally won't know the extent to which the recipient has seen, logged, or responded to previous GPC signals, so the header should be always sent so long as the consumer hasn't changed their preference. On the other hand, if the user hasn't activated GPC, or subsequently turns it off, the signal should never be sent (what constitutes user intent to turn on the signal is a different question raised by Issue #52).\r\n\r\nI can imagine a mechanism where a user agent could be configured by the user to whitelist certain domains to not receive the signal (e.g., a particular website asks to be exempted from the general preference to not have data shared and the user agrees). I would be fine clarifying that in the spec, though again the signal would still be binary: either the header would be persistently sent because the user wants to send it to that domain, or the header wouldn't be sent.

For example, if GPC is turned on (via the header or JS property), the IAB's GPP `usca` is set accordingly by the CMP. I have not done exhaustive studies on this point, but in general it should be the case. Any particular CMP should be able to answer that question for their platform.",

    "reason": "This comment is expressing dissatisfaction about certain concerns raised previously, implying that some issues were not fully addressed or discussed. The commenter does not provide new information but rather reiterates their objections to a feature or deployment decision. This suggests that the issue is more of a philosophical one (e.g., whether the approach should be maintained) than an administrative or technical issue that needs to be resolved immediately, and hence it could also be classified as a Feature Request."
