It is a powerful tool that complicates the fateful cat-and-mouse game.\r\n\r\nAs you say, to defend sites from anti-automation, there are CAPTCHAs. CAPTCHAs can be resolved by AIs relatively easily, and then the defender perhaps puts other countermeasures in place to protect himself. Also, there is an ongoing discussion in several communities regarding CAPTCHAs' usefulness (and the use, for example, of JavaScript challenges that do not worsen the user's UX). \r\n\r\nConversely, defenders can use WAFs that use AIs to protect themselves from attacks and not use regexp or visitation behaviors to figure out whether it is a bot (which may also have privacy effects).\r\n\r\nIs a particularly interesting and broad topic.",

(Many of these issues are already mentioned in other \"advisement\" sections.) Issues on ergonomy, on user interface, etc, should also get a special attention.\r\n\r\nW3C has experience, largely, though not exclusively, due to the WAI activity, on creating such guidelines, how to manage them, present them, etc. This may become extremely useful.\r\n\r\n(This is clearly related to #25.)",

Open standards are needed to enable open and free competition for personal assistants based upon generative AI.  Such assistants would build upon an open ecosystem of services with heterogeneous business models and machine interpretable descriptions that facilitate service composition. In principle, W3C could play a strategic role for community building and standards development.  We would need to identify which national and international bodies would have a shared interest in encouraging this further.
