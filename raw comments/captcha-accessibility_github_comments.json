This practice discriminates against people with visual disabilities, and blocks them from getting access to services and information on the web.\n> \n> The reCAPTCHA Google Group and other forums have several threads about people with disabilities looking for a solution because of the blocked audio challenge, this is one of them: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/recaptcha/5TFQ2c4phPU/discussion\n> \n> https://groups.google.com/forum/?nomobile=true#!searchin/recaptcha/audio%7Csort:date\n> https://www.google.com/search?q=%22audio%22+%22captcha%22+OR+%22recaptcha%22+%22automated+queries%22\n> \n> This is the message people are encountered with when they try to access the audio challenge: Your computer or network may be sending automated queries.

People have reported some level of success in accessing the audio challenge by switching to Chrome and staying always logged into their Google accounts.\n> \n> The reCAPTCHA service is also hostile to users connecting from VPNs or anonymizing services such as Tor. The audio challenge is almost always blocked when using Tor, and the visual challenge may be blocked as well, or serves several challenges in a row and refuses to accept correct solutions.\n> \n> Because of the dominance of the reCAPTCHA service, people seeking privacy are effectively prevented from accessing large portions of the web.\n> \n> -- \n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> w3c/captcha-accessibility#28\n\n-- \n\nJanina Sajka\n\nLinux Foundation Fellow\nExecutive Chair, Accessibility Workgroup:\thttp://a11y.org\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)\nChair, Accessible Platform Architectures\thttp://www.w3.org/wai/apa\n\n",

There was an option for a person with a disability to register with the vendor to bypass the CAPTCHA challenge, which was otherwise inaccessible to nonvisual users.\r\n\r\nProblem 1: to bypass the CAPTCHA, I had to register, thus revealing myself to have a disability.\r\n\r\nProblem 2: The bypass process, involving a cookie, didn't work. I eventually identified the reason: I had to turn off or create an exception to browser privacy settings that blocked third-party cookies in order for their cookie to be available on the Web sites that presented the CAPTCHA challenge. In other words, it was necessary to reduce one's privacy protection by manipulating browser settings.\r\n\r\nIn general, I don't think this is the kind of solution we should be encouraging in our document.",

There is a sufficient variety of hardware devices supporting WebAuthn that no single biological characteristic need be relied upon for biometrics - as is required for accessibility.

Of course, the user can choose the authentication device, as long as the vendor is trusted by the Web site operator whose services are to be accessed.\r\n\r\nWould such a solution meet the security requirements of Web-based service providers?
